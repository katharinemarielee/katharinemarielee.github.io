I am a biological anthropologist and engineer studying women's health using theoretical perspectives derived from feminist biology and anthropology. I am currently an assistant professor at Tulane University in the [Department of Anthropology](https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/anthropology). Prior to this position, I was an NIH-funded postdoctoral research scholar in the [Division of Public Health Sciences](https://publichealthsciences.wustl.edu) at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. I completed my PhD in Anthropology with a graduate minor in Gender and Women’s Studies and a graduate certificate in Science Communication at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I also hold a MS in Business Administration (Texas A&M-Texarkana) and a BS in Biomedical Engineering (Tulane University). I work to combine my experience in engineering to optimize data collection and manipulation techniques with anthropology to situate that data in complex social and historical contexts.

My dissertation focused on how physical activity and reproductive hormones across the lifespan affect bone in healthy adult premenopausal women in the U.S. and in rural Poland. My dissertation research was supported by numerous funders, including the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, and the American Philosophical Society.

An additional area of my research interrogates how identity – gender, sex, sexual orientation, race, ability, and religion – interacts with experiences of hostile work climate and harassment for people in astronomy and planetary sciences.
